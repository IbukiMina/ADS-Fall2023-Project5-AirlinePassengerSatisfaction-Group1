+ Project summary: We conduct a series of prediction models to determine the best fit model for predicting airline customer satisfaction. We utilize an airline passenger satistfaction survey to determine which factors lead to a satisfied, and likewise disatisfied customer. To predict customer satisfaction, we use five different models, the Random Forest classifier, XG Boost, KNN, Ada Boost, and Gradient Boosting. We employed these methods and compared their accuracy to determine the best fit for prediction.
